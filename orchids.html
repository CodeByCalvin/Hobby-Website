          <p class="post-paragraph">
            Unlike many other houseplants, orchids don't do well with a regular
            watering schedule. Instead, they prefer to almost dry out between
            waterings. When it's time to water, thoroughly soak the orchid's
            potting mixâ€”then let it drain completely. Overwatering can lead to
            root rot, a common issue with orchids.

          <h2 class="post-subheading">The Right Environment for Orchids</h2>

          <p class="post-paragraph">
            Orchids generally prefer bright, indirect light. A north or
            east-facing window is often an excellent spot for these plants.
            Moreover, because they're native to tropical regions, most orchids
            prefer high humidity and warm temperatures. However, each species
            has its own specific needs, so it's essential to research the
            particular type of orchid you have.
