          <p class="post-paragraph">
            Houseplant succulents come in an astonishing variety of shapes,
            sizes, and colors. Each species has its unique charm, but some have
            gained more popularity due to their distinctive looks and easy care.
            <br />
            <br />The Jade Plant, with its thick, shiny leaves, and the Aloe
            Vera, with its healing properties, are two of the most well-known.
            The Echeveria, known for its rosette shape and vibrant colors, and
            the Zebra Plant (Haworthia), small and perfect for desktops, are
            also fan favorites.

          <h2 class="post-subheading">Watering routine</h2>

          <p class="post-paragraph">
            Succulents hail from arid regions, so they're adapted to survive
            with little water. In fact, overwatering is the quickest way to kill
            a succulent! It's best to water these plants thoroughly but
            infrequently, letting the soil dry out completely between watering
            sessions. During the winter, when the plants go dormant, they
            require even less water.

          <h2 class="post-subheading">Soil and potting</h2>

          <p class="post-paragraph">
            Well-draining soil is crucial for healthy succulents. A mix of
            potting soil with coarse sand, pumice, or perlite is ideal. When it
            comes to choosing a pot, always go for one with a drainage hole.
            This allows excess water to escape, preventing root rot. Remember,
            succulents prefer being a bit snug in their pots, so there's no need
            to opt for a massive pot for your small succulent.
